# NASA-APOD

### Astronomy Picture of the Day
Astronomy Picture of the Day is a website provided by NASA and Michigan Technological University. According to the website, "Each day a different image or photograph of our universe is featured, along with a brief explanation written by a professional astronomer." The photograph does not necessarily correspond to a celestial event on the exact day that it is displayed, and images are sometimes repeated. However, the pictures and descriptions often relate to current events in astronomy and space exploration.

### NASA APOD API
NASA allows developers to access NASA data, including imagery, eminently through different APIs and APOD is one of them. Developers can retrieve the current picture of the day, or the picture for a given date. An API key is required for high-volume usage. All API calls are RESTful.
