### Astronomy Picture of the Day
Astronomy Picture of the Day is a website provided by NASA and Michigan Technological University. According to the website, "Each day a different image or photograph of our universe is featured, along with a brief explanation written by a professional astronomer." The photograph does not necessarily correspond to a celestial event on the exact day that it is displayed, and images are sometimes repeated. However, the pictures and descriptions often relate to current events in astronomy and space exploration.
